✅ No text hidden behind header (110px padding)
✅ Checkbox appears in Hindi (मैंने ऊपर दिए गए सभी नियम और शर्तें पढ़ी और समझी हैं)
✅ Checkbox appears in Gujarati (મેં ઉપરોક્ત તમામ નિયમો અને શરતોને વાંચી અને સમજી છે)
✅ Checkbox appears in all other languages
✅ Proper spacing on all pages

All files are ready in your local folder and pushed to GitHub.
